## Alternative Distsql Plan Viewer 

An alternative viewer for distsql plans generated by the 
`EXPLAIN ANALYZE (DISTSQL)` command.




The plan viewer has different views: 
* Heatmap: a table that lists all the processors and edges with relative metrics
* Graph: A direct acyclic graph that shows how the various processors are used to execute the query
* SQL: The original SQL Query
* Plan: the plan in JSON format



The viewer uses the same encoding of the viewer at `https://cockroachdb.github.io/distsqlplan/decode.html`.

To use, simply modify the url generated by `EXPLAIN ANALYZE (DISTSQL)`, replacing  `https://cockroachdb.github.io/distsqlplan/decode.html` with `https://cockroachdb.github.io/altdistsqlplan/decode.html`
